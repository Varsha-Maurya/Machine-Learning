This folder contains all Machine learning assignments.

## Assignment 0

This assignment aims to visualize data from dataset for Classification and Regression models. While visualizing the data, we come to understand the purpose and scenarios where Supervised learning models i.e Classification and Regression can be aptly applied to get meaningful insights from features present in the data and how it can be efficiently used to classify or predict new data instances.Regression model is statistical method for analysing a data set in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The goal is to describe the relationship between target and predicators in order to be able to predict new data instances. Multicollinearity between predictors and relationship between predictors and target drived the searching condition for regression data. Here we have visualized some interesting features on King county Housing data to model how different features affect the target predication when different predictors are used. Classification model hugely depends on independence among predictors and assumes that features are generally not affected or dependent on other existing features in the dataset. In cases where some features are dependent on each other, this should not hinder any feature in providing independent probability of the result. The main criteria while finding data for classification was to find multiclass labelled data that could be classified in different mostly non-overlapping data clusters which can be used for new data points. We have tried to visualize Classification technique on US census data to see how different independent features can help us in understanding the demographics better and can classify new given observations. Here while working on the data visualization, we also get familiar to tools like Python, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and Jupyter notebook."

## Assignment 1
For regression we have used Assignment#0 dataset of Seattle housing prices and perform linear regression on the variables that we had deduced were having direct correlation on the housing prices and analyse how correct our assumption was with that regard.

## Assignment 2
In this assignment we have implemented classification models like Linear discriminant analysis(LDA), Quadratic discriminant analysis(QDA), Logistic Regression and Pocket algorithm. Implementation of these algorithm will be done on classification dataset on related to Weather in Australia. We have also examined the accuracy obtained by implemented algorithms and understand difference between each algorithm. The goal of this assignment is to successfully implement pocket algorithm, discriminant analysis, and logistic regression on the dataset so as to correctly determine if a set of variables is effective in predicting category classes.

## Assignment 3
In this assignment we have tried to implement Neural Network Algorithm.

## Assignment 4
In this assignment we are trying to play Blackjack with the dealer using Markov Decision Process.
We will try to understand the process of Blackjack and then determine which MDP process is the best for black jack.
we will try and understand different techiques in MDP.

## Assignment 5
In this assignment I have implemented deep network like Feed Forward(FF), Deep Feed Forward(DFF) and Recurrent Neural Network(RNN). Implementation of these networks will be done on different suitable datasets. We will also examine the accuracy obtained by each implemention and understand difference between the networks. The goal of this assignment is to successfully implement Feed Forward(FF), Deep Feed Forward(DFF) and Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) on dataset so as to find the respective accuracies. In addition to this, we have also implemented LSTM on Air Quality dataset.
